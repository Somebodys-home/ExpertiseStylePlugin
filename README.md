1. How to make ability items:
- In the ExpertiseSystem/(expertise), make the effects, items, and listener class
- make the item in the item class that should extend the AbilityItemTemplate class
- create the ability effect in the effect class
- in the listener, just copy what I did in SoldierListener but for that expertise specifically

Todo (from most to least important atm):
1. Import the damage plugin successfully
2. import the attributes plugin successfully
3. at least get a basic skill done for every expertise in the game
4. finish the entire style system
